### 👋 About me

I’m a **Data Engineer / ML Engineer** focused on **designing end-to-end data systems**:  
from ingestion and orchestration to analytics, ML, and deployment.

I care deeply about:
- Correctness over demos  
- Scalability over scripts  
- Architecture over isolated models  

Most of my work revolves around **real constraints**: volume, latency, idempotency, costs, governance, and maintainability.

---

### 🚀 What I actually build

- **End-to-end data platforms** (ingestion → transformation → analytics → ML)
- **Production-ready ML pipelines** (training, inference, monitoring)
- **APIs for data & ML systems** (FastAPI-first mindset)
- **Cloud-native architectures** (AWS & GCP)
- **Automation-heavy workflows** (Airflow, event-driven patterns)

---

### 🧠 Current focus

- Distributed data pipelines with **Airflow & Kafka**
- ML systems beyond training: **serving, feedback loops, monitoring**
- Cloud architectures that scale without becoming unmaintainable
- Turning complex requirements into clean, auditable systems
